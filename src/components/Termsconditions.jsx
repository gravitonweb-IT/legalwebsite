          The user acknowledges that certified lawyers will refrain from

          LEGAL257 may modify this agreement at its discretion. Users are
          required to regularly review the Terms and Conditions. Continued use

          LEGAL257 reserves the right to modify or suspend its services,

          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        </p>
        <p className="text-medium mt-3">
          Mitigating potential liabilities is a critical concern for LEGAL257
          and other online platform operators. The risk lies in being held
          accountable for the actions of users, even when the platform is not
          directly responsible. For instance, if a user defames another,
          LEGAL257 could face unwarranted blame. Similarly, a user uploading a
          virus might result in LEGAL257 being wrongly accused when it is the
          transmitting user at fault. Instances where users transfer
          inappropriate information could also lead to unjust repercussions for
          LEGAL257. To address this, all users must acknowledge and take
          responsibility for their own actions. Any harm caused by one user to
          another should be attributed solely to the responsible user, not the
          platform. It is imperative for users to accept liability, recognizing
          that LEGAL257 merely facilitates communication between users and
          should not be held culpable for the misconduct of individual users.
        </p>

        <p className="text-medium mt-3">
          While LEGAL257 strives to maintain secure and high-quality systems,
          occasional errors or system failures may occur. Operating a system of
          this magnitude inevitably involves challenges, and providing this
          service would be impractical if we were to assume liability or
          financial responsibility for usability issues, system failures,
          errors, or damages of any nature. In order to ensure the continuity of
          our offerings and enhance our services, LEGAL257 disclaims any
          guarantees associated with this service and explicitly limits our
          liability for any issues related to the use of our system.

          It's crucial to understand that in situations beyond our control, such
          as department holidays, delays by the Government of India, national
          holidays, state government actions, events like acts of war, acts of
          God, earthquakes, protests, demolitions, labor shortages, conflicts,
          internet suspensions, power disturbances, phone network issues,
          mechanical failures, sea cable damage, hacking, and forgery, we cannot
          be held responsible for any delays.

          If your refund request is approved, subject to the terms and
          conditions outlined here or elsewhere, we will email you to gather the
          necessary details for compensation. This may include your bank account
          information such as the account number and the IFS code of the branch.
          Please be aware that it will take us a minimum of 48-72 working hours
          from the receipt of this information to process the refund and
          initiate the transfer. Additionally, no refunds are provided for
          consultation services once they have been received.
