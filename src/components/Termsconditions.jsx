          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        </p>
        <p className="text-medium mt-3">
          A great risk for LEGAL257, and for all operators of online systems, is
          that we might be held responsible for the wrongful activities of our
          users. If one user defames another user, the harmed user might blame
          LEGAL257, even though the first user was really to blame. If a user
          uploads a data with a network virus, and the other users' processors
          are damaged, we might be blamed even though a user who transmitted the
          virus on our system is at fault. If a user transfers illegal or
          inappropriate information to another user, we might be blamed even
          though we did nothing more than unknowingly convey the message from
          one user to another. Accordingly, we need all users to accept the
          liability for their own actions, and to admit that an act by another
          user that damages them must not be blamed on us, but only on the other
          user.

          Although it is the goal of LEGAL257 to provide users with secure and
          quality systems, we may make errors or encounter system failure from
          time to time. Such problems are unavoidable in operating a system of
          this magnitude. We would not be able to make this practice available
          to users if we had to accept liability or financial liability for any
          usability intricacies, system failures or errors, or mistakes or
          damages of any kind. In order to commit continuity of offerings and
          improving our services, LEGAL257 denies any guarantees on this service
          and states that our liability for any predicaments connected with the

          from our side, beyond the time frame we have hinted to you, due to
