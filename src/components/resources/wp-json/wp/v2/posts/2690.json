This blog discusses Professional Tax in Maharashtra.<\/p>\n<p>In the <strong>Income Tax Act, of 1961<\/strong>, professional tax is a deductible amount and can be deducted from taxable income.<\/p>\n<p><strong>According to Article 246 of the Constitution of India, <\/strong>laws relating to the Union List, including income tax, can only be passed by Parliament. States can only enact concurrent and state-list laws.<\/p>\n<h2>Professional Tax (PT) in India<\/h2>\n<p>In India, several state governments levy a professional tax. People working in various professions pay taxes on their income. Under Article 276 (2) of the Constitution of India, the Government of India in 1949 authorized the states to collect a professional tax. Occupation tax is very similar to income tax. There is one difference between the two: the state government levies professional tax while the state levies income tax. Initially, when it was launched, Rs. 250 was considered a professional fee. In 1998, the amount was increased to Rs. 2500. The state government sought to increase the professional tax from Rs. 2500 to 7000 Rs in recent years. However, the Government of India has not reduced the amount so far and its maximum amount remains the same.<\/p>\n<h2>Professional taxes &#8211; who collects them?<\/h2>\n<p>Employers collect professional tax from the monthly salary.<\/p>\n<p>After collecting the professional tax, employers pay the state. Otherwise, they could be fined if they don&#8217;t accept them or don&#8217;t pay. If you do not work for someone else,<\/p>\n<p>you must pay professional tax. Professionals without an employer can register by filling out an application. The person gets the registration number after receiving the form. The invitation fee can be paid in banks with registration number. In addition, certain states also offer tax incentives to professionals who pay their taxes in lump sum for several years at a time. so it&#8217;s worth checking your state&#8217;s tax laws.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"c648b26c88ca241a\" role=\"tooltip\" aria-label=\"similar text found on zoho.com\" data-microtip-position=\"bottom\">Applicability of Professional Tax (PT)<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies<\/li>\n<li>Firms<\/li>\n<li>Surveyors<\/li>\n<li>Tax consultants<\/li>\n<li>Management consultants<\/li>\n<li>Medical representatives such as doctors, medical consultants, and dentists<\/li>\n<li>LLPs<\/li>\n<li>Contractors<\/li>\n<li>Architects<\/li>\n<li>Engineers<\/li>\n<li>Insurance agents<\/li>\n<li>Corporation Societies<\/li>\n<li>HUF Associations<\/li>\n<li>Clubs<\/li>\n<li>Legal practitioners<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>such as solicitors Chartered Accountants CS Professional tax rate The profession tax charged by the state government varies from state to state.
