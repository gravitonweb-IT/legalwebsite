Both VAT and GST have the same taxation slabs. It is a comprehensive, multistage, destination-based tax: comprehensive because it has subsumed almost all the indirect taxes except a few state taxes. Multi-staged as it is, the GST is imposed at every step in the production process but is meant to be refunded to all parties in the various stages of production other than the final consumer, and as a destination-based tax, it is collected from the point of consumption and not a point of origin like previous taxes. The following blog has a detailed description of <a href=\"https:\/\/legal251.com\/gst-registration\">GST Registration<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>INTRODUCTION<\/h2>\n<p>In the tax system, registration of the company entity is essential for both obtaining the Input Tax Credit and collecting taxes on the government&#8217;s behalf. Under GST Law, registering any company entity is crucial for tax collection from customers and obtaining the Input Tax Credit. Any business entity that is unable to register themselves will not be able to collect tax from customers or benefit from the Input Tax Credit.<\/p>\n<p>For some special category states, the aggregate turnover is 20 Lacs in a financial year for the registration of any business entity. Anyone with an annual turnover of more than 40 Lacs is required to be registered under the act.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, the tax authority issues the relevant details the Unique Identification Number, which contains bank account details the Permanent Account Number (PAN), and the State-specific number, following the registration of any company entity. Basically, The 15-digit GST Identification Number (GSTIN), also known as the Unique Identification Number, is used to identify goods and services. The State code is represented by the first two digits of the GST Identification Number (GSTIN), while the taxpayer&#8217;s Permanent Account Number (PAN) is represented by the next ten digits. Next, the fourteenth digit of the Unique Identification Number\u2014Z by default\u2014and the fifteenth digit\u2014for check code\u2014indicate the number of registrations inside the state. The thirteenth digit of the Unique Identification Number follows.<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 sub-tabs under the registration tab, namely: New registration &#8211; This tab contains a brand-new, complete GST registration for taxpayers. Under the services tab of the GST Portal, there are 4 kinds of sub-categories: Under the registration tab, every taxpayer can register in the goods and services tax regime.<\/p>\n<h2>DEFINITION<\/h2>\n<h3><strong>The term GST is defined in Article 366 (12A)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cany tax on supply of goods or services or both except taxes on supply of the alcoholic liquor for human consumption.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Definition of Supply<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>supply\u2019 includes all forms of supply of goods and\/or services such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, license, rental, and lease made or agreed to be made for consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business, (b) importation of service, for a consideration whether or not in the course or furtherance of business.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Definition of Goods<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Goods&#8221; refers to any movable items, excluding cash and securities, but also to actionable claims, growing crops, grass, and items attached to or constituting a part of the land that are agreed to be severed prior to supply or as specified in the supply contract; Actionable Claim if only Lottery, Gambling or betting shall be treated as Supply Intangible Assets like DEPB License to be treated as \u201cGoods\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Definition of Services<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In terms of Section 2(102) \u201cServices\u201d means anything other than goods, money, and securities.<\/p>\n<h2>LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF GOODS AND SERVICE TAX (GST)<\/h2>\n<h3>1. <strong>Taxable Event under GST<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>An occurrence that triggers a tax liability is known as a &#8220;taxable event.&#8221; The&#8217; supply of goods and\/or services&#8217; is regarded as a taxable event in the context of GST.<\/p>\n<h3>2. <strong>Applicable on Supply<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>The tax was levied under the previous tax system on both the sale of products and the rendering of services. The term &#8220;supply&#8221; has, however, been expanded under the GST to include all types of supply, including sale, transfer, barter, rental, provision, exchange, license, lease, and disposal.<\/p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Nature of Supply<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>GST is assessed on the provision of goods and services, as was previously mentioned. Therefore, a key factor in determining which type of GST is applied to the transaction is the nature of the supplier. This means that IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax) will be levied on interstate supplies while CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) and SGST (State Goods and Services Tax) will be levied on intrastate supplies.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, when the supply of goods and services is within a Union Territory, UTGST (Union Territory Goods and Services Tax) and CGST will be applicable.<\/p>\n<h3>4. <strong>Destination-Based Tax<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>GST abides by the premise of destination-based consumption taxation. According to this approach, GST will be applied at the point of consumption rather than the point of origin, meaning that the goods and services will be subject to tax if they are used domestically. This theory explains why imports are liable to GST but exports are not.<\/p>\n<div class=\"group final-completion w-full text-token-text-primary border-b border-black\/10 gizmo:border-0 dark:border-gray-900\/50 gizmo:dark:border-0 bg-gray-50 gizmo:bg-transparent dark:bg-[#444654] gizmo:dark:bg-transparent\" data-testid=\"conversation-turn-35\">\n<div class=\"p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 gizmo:gap-3 gizmo:md:px-5 gizmo:lg:px-1 gizmo:xl:px-5 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] gizmo:md:max-w-3xl gizmo:lg:max-w-[40rem] gizmo:xl:max-w-[48rem] xl:max-w-3xl }\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gizmo:w-full lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)] agent-turn\">\n<div class=\"flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words overflow-x-auto\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<p>Let&#8217;s illustrate this with an example: Consider that goods are manufactured in Rajasthan but sold in Maharashtra. In such a case, IGST will be applicable, where the Central Government retains a certain proportion of the tax, and the remaining proportion is allocated to the State Government (Maharashtra) where the goods were consumed.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>5. <strong>Dual GST<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>India follows a dual GST model, wherein both the state and the central government impose GST on the supply of goods and services concurrently. In India GST comprises of:-<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>CGST<\/td>\n<td>Imposed and collected by the Central Government on intrastate supplies.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SGST<\/td>\n<td>Imposed and collected by State Government or Union Territories with legislative assembly, i.e. Delhi, Pondicherry, and Jammu and Kashmir on intrastate supplies.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTGST<\/td>\n<td>Imposed and collected by Union Territories without Legislative Assemblies on intrastate supplies.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IGST<\/td>\n<td>Imposed and collected by the central government on all interstate supply of goods and services. It is the sum total of CGST and SGST\/UTGST.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>6. <strong>Classification of Goods and Services<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>In the goods and services tax, the classification of goods and services utilizes a Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN). This classification divides them into five different types of slabs or tax rates, which are 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, based on the requirements of the taxpayer.<\/p>\n<h3>7. <strong>Registration<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>It is necessary to obtain registration by every supplier of goods and services, from the state or union territory where the supplier provides taxable supply when the aggregate turnover in the financial year is greater than the limit specified in this regard. Moreover, suppliers involved in the e-commerce business and those who are engaged in interstate sales also require registration under GST.<\/p>\n<p>Further, the threshold limit varies from one State\/UT to another, depending upon the supply, i.e. whether the supplier is engaged in the supply of goods only, services only, or both.<\/p>\n<h3>8. <strong>Payment of Tax<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n<p>Suppliers can opt for any of the two modes for making GST Payment:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronic Payment Mode.<\/li>\n<li>Over the Counter payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>WHY IS GST IMPORTANT?<\/h2>\n<p>It is significant because it succeeded in unifying India&#8217;s taxation, which increased confidence abroad in Indian products and services. Additionally, because businesses could now function under a single common taxation system, doing business within the nation became exceedingly simple.<\/p>\n<h3>How GST Works?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manufacturer<\/strong>: The manufacturer will have to pay GST on the raw material that is purchased and the value that has been added to make the product.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Service Provider<\/strong>: In this case, the GST services provider will be responsible for paying GST on both the product&#8217;s purchase price and the value added to it. However, the manufacturer&#8217;s tax payment may be deducted from the total GST that must be paid.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Retailer<\/strong>: It must be paid by the retailer on both the product they bought from the distributor and the margin they added. However, the retailer&#8217;s tax payment may be deducted from the total amount of GST that must be paid.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Consumer<\/strong>: GST must be paid on the product that has been purchased.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>TYPES OF GST<\/h2>\n<p>THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF GST:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. State Goods and Service Tax (SGST),<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Union Territory Goods and Service Tax (UTGST)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST)<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Features of Goods and Services Tax (GST)<\/h2>\n<p>The salient features of goods and services tax (GST) are discussed here under:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Tax<\/strong>: GST is comprehensive in nature because it has substituted various indirect taxes in India, <strong>for example<\/strong>, Sales tax, Service Tax, Excise Duty, Entertainment tax, VAT, luxury tax, entry tax, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multistage Tax<\/strong>: GST is imposed on each stage of the production process on the value addition made by each party. However, the input tax credit is available to all the parties, except the final consumer of the goods and services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Destination-based tax<\/strong>: As GST is collected from the point of consumption, i.e. the final consumer, it is a destination-based tax.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tax Credit<\/strong>: GST offers an inclusive and continuous chain of tax credits from the point of view of the producer or service provider. In this way, tax is levied only on the value addition at each stage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tax burden falls on the final consumer<\/strong>: The supplier of goods or service provider can avail of the input tax credit at each stage, on the GST paid on inputs and set off the credit against the GST payable on the supply. In this way, it is the final consumer who bears the tax burden, on the GST charged by the last supplier in the supply chain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eliminating the Cascading Effect:<\/strong> In the previous tax regime, the biggest issue was the cascading effect, which resulted in double taxation of goods. However, with the emergence of GST, it completely eliminates the cascading effect as only the value added at each stage is taxed.\n<div class=\"p-4 justify-center text-base md:gap-6 md:py-6 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-1 gap-4 text-base mx-auto md:gap-6 gizmo:gap-3 gizmo:md:px-5 gizmo:lg:px-1 gizmo:xl:px-5 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] gizmo:md:max-w-3xl gizmo:lg:max-w-[40rem] gizmo:xl:max-w-[48rem] xl:max-w-3xl }\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gizmo:w-full lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)] agent-turn\">\n<div class=\"flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3\">\n<div class=\"flex justify-between empty:hidden gizmo:justify-start gizmo:gap-3 lg:block\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>GST REGISTRATION<\/h2>\n<p>Every business with a revenue of Rs 4 lakhs must register for GST as a\u00a0 regular taxpayer under the GST regime.
