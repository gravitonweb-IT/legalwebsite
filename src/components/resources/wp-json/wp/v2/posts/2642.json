Alternatively, they can also make use of Aadhar-based electronic signatures to file the returns.<\/li>\n<li>Taxable Turnover (other than the zero-rated ones).<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4>Zero-rated supply on payment of Tax:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here, you need to enter all those exports, deemed or otherwise made without a Letter of Undertaking. Owing to this reason, the exporter is liable to pay GST on the exported goods and services. They can get a refund back later.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Zero-rated supply without payment of Tax:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This refers to exports made along with a LUT or the Letter of Undertaking. This is a letter that enables the exporter to sell goods overseas\/to SEZ units without charging GST.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Turnover from deemed exports:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This refers to the deemed exports are items sold to overseas customers and specialized units. However, in this case, the goods don\u2019t leave the country.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Turnover from exempted supplies:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This refers to the goods and services that do not attract GST. However, the taxpayer can\u2019t claim a refund on the tax paid on input services and goods that were used to render them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Turnover from Nil-rated supplies:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are the goods that come under 0% GST. However, the taxpayer can claim a refund of tax paid on the input goods and services used for creating them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Turnover from non-GST supplies:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This refers to the goods and services that are beyond the dimensions of GST but still attract some local taxes.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Inter-State supplies (Net Supply for the month)\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Under this heading, we have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>Taxable supplies (other than reverse charged and zero-rated supply) [Tax Rate Wise]:<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This will have all your sales except the ones on which reverse charge has been applied.

It\u2019s issued to a taxpayer who has failed to file their GST returns on time for a particular tax period. Upon receiving the GSTR-3A, the taxpayer will have a maximum of 15 days from the date of default to remedy the situation (including any penalties or late fees).<\/li>\n<li>The GSTR-3B is a consolidated summary return of inward and outward supplies that the Government of India has introduced as a way to relax the requirements for businesses that have recently transitioned to GST.<\/li>\n<li>Since a lot of small and medium businesses have been using manual accounting methods, filing returns within the July 2017 deadlines would be difficult for many of these businesses. Hence, from July 2017 to June 2018, tax payments will be based on a simple return called the GSTR-3B.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Format of GSTR-3<\/h2>\n<p>The format of GSTR-3 is divided into 13 tables, which are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1.

Table 13 &#8211; These tables contain information regarding the taxpayer&#8217;s sales, purchases, input tax credit, output tax liability, interest, late fees payable, and tax paid under the reverse charge mechanism, among other things.
