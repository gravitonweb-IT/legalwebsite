The said Scheme of the government of India provides medical and financial assistance to the employees. In case the employee is unable to work due to sickness, employment injuries, or maternity, ESI Scheme comes into force.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Critical Components of the Scheme<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The Employees\u2019 State Insurance Act of 1948 governs the ESI Scheme. Following is a breakdown of the critical components of the Scheme:<\/p>\n<p><em>Scope of Coverage<\/em>: The Scheme covers employees who are subscribed or enrolled in the program. It may be mandatory for employers to register their employees for the Scheme, or it could be an opt-in option for employees to participate voluntarily.<\/p>\n<p><em>Protection against Employment Injury<\/em>: The Scheme provides coverage to employees who sustain injuries or disabilities directly related to their work. This may include accidents, occupational diseases, or other work-related health conditions.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sickness Benefits<\/em>: In case of non-work-related sickness or medical conditions, the Scheme provides financial assistance to employees to help them cope with the loss of income during their illness.<\/p>\n<p><em>Maternity Benefits<\/em>: The Scheme supports female employees during pregnancy and childbirth. Maternity benefits can include paid leave during the maternity period to help them manage their financial needs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Medical Care and Other Benefits<\/em>: The Scheme provides access to medical care and other benefits to covered employees. Medical expenses related to injuries, sickness, and maternity may be covered under the Scheme to ensure that employees can receive necessary treatments without significant financial burden.<\/p>\n<p><em>Replacing Loss of Salary<\/em>: One of the critical objectives of the Scheme is to replace a portion of the employee&#8217;s lost salary or income during periods of disability, sickness, or maternity leave. This financial assistance helps individuals and their families maintain a basic living standard during these challenging times.<\/p>\n<p>The primary goal of the ESI scheme is to provide a safety net for employees and their families, ensuring their well-being and financial stability during times of need.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>History of Employees\u2019 State Insurance Corporation <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru inaugurated the Scheme in Kanpur on 24th February 1952. The venue was the Brijender Swarup Park. The Scheme was simultaneously launched in Delhi as well, and the initial coverage for both centers was 1,20,000 employees. Our first prime Minister was the first honorary insured person of the Scheme, and the declaration form bearing his signature is a prized possession of the Employees\u2019 State Insurance Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Does the ESIC Works?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/legal251.com\/legal251app\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1898\" src=\"https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"How Does the ESIC Works\" width=\"1058\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04104152\/How-Does-the-ESIC-Works.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><em>a.) Where is it applicable? <\/em><\/h3>\n<p>The ESI scheme applies to entities or establishments that employ ten or more employees. The Scheme covers various sectors and industries, including shops, hotels, restaurants, cinemas, road motor transport establishments, newspaper establishments, and private educational and medical institutions. The number of employees required to subscribe to the ESI scheme can vary between states. Each state government has the authority to determine the minimum threshold for coverage. For instance, in some states, the threshold may be ten or more employees, while in others, it may be twenty or more employees. Therefore, it is essential to refer to the specific rules and guidelines set by the state government where the entity is located to determine the precise applicability criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the ESI scheme provides medical care, cash benefits, and various other facilities to covered employees and their dependents. The employer and the employee contribute to the Scheme, and the funds are managed by the Employees&#8217; State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), a statutory body under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India.<\/p>\n<h3><em>b.) Wage Limit<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Employees working for factories or establishments with ten or more employees earning a monthly salary of up to Rs. 21,000 are entitled to health benefits under the ESI Act in India.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding exemptions, individuals with a daily average wage of Rs. 176\/- or below are exempted from contributing to the ESI scheme from their wages. Only the employer&#8217;s contribution is paid for these employees in such cases. This exemption relieves lower-wage employees from contributing a portion of their salary towards the ESI scheme while still providing them access to health benefits. It is important to note that the specific thresholds and exemptions may vary between states and can be subject to updates or changes by the relevant authorities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>ESIC Registration process<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/legal251.com\/legal251app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1896\" src=\"https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"ESIC Registration process\" width=\"1060\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/legal251resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/04103147\/ESIC-Registration-process.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Step 1: Log in to ESIC Portal<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">An employer requires getting himself registered on the ESIC portal.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">An employer can register by clicking the \u2018Sign Up\u2019 button on the ESIC portal under the \u2018Employer Login option on the home screen.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The employers must fill in the details after clicking the \u2018Sign up\u2019 button and submitting the form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Step 2: Confirmation Mail<\/h4>\n<p>After submitting the form for sign-up to the portal, the employer will obtain a confirmation mail sent to the registered mail ID &amp; mobile number entered at the time of sign-up.
